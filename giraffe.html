                    <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. Its species name refer to its camel-like coat colouring. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and long legs with its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, alon with its closest extant relative the okapi. The nine subspecies are distinguished by theie coat patterns</p>
                    
                    <p>The giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to the South Africa in the south, from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands, primary food source is acacia leaves, which they brows at heights most other herbivours dont reach.</p>
                    
                    <p>Giraffes are preyed on by lions; their calves are also targeted mostly by African wild digs. Adult giraffes do no have strong social bonds, though they do gather in large groups which happen to be moving in the same general direction. Maless establish social hierarchies through "necking" combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear sole responsibility for raising the young.</p>
